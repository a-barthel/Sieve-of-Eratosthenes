This file contains all of the output of each part of the project.  This is
here because at the end of the lab handout it asks for printed output so I am
making sure you have it if something goes wrong.  There was use of unicode
characters in the programs so you never know.  Hopefully, if they don't show
up in grading they will show up here!


* UPDATE : After copy and pasting the first part of part A, it is very clear
  that text files in the terminal on Data do not support unicode.  Again, it
  works fine running the file on the shell on Data.  Please refer to that
  output if you want to see the unicode characters. *


PART A:

	Subpart One (10^6):

		Calculate the prime numbers p such that p = {p ∈ ℤ | 0
		≤ p ≤ 10^6 and p is only divisible by one and itself}.

		The first 5 primes are: 
		1 : 2
		2 : 3
		3 : 5
		4 : 7
		5 : 11

		The last 5 primes are: 
		78494 : 999953
		78495 : 999959
		78496 : 999961
		78497 : 999979
		78498 : 999983

		The total number of primes up to 10^6 is: 78498
		The approximate number of primes is: π(10^6) = 10^6/ln(10^6)
		= 72382

	Subpart Two (7^t):

		The number of primes up to and including 7^t such that t = {t
		∈ ℤ | 2 ≤ t ≤ 7}:

		t = 2 : 15	π(7^2) = 7^2/ln(7^2) = 12
		t = 3 : 68	π(7^3) = 7^3/ln(7^3) = 58
		t = 4 : 357	π(7^4) = 7^4/ln(7^4) = 308
		t = 5 : 1939	π(7^5) = 7^5/ln(7^5) = 1727
		t = 6 : 11098	π(7^6) = 7^6/ln(7^6) = 10076
		t = 7 : 65685	π(7^7) = 7^7/ln(7^7) = 60459

PART B:

		Calculate the prime numbers p such that p = {p ∈ ℤ |
		2*10^8 ≤ p ≤ 2*10^8+10^6 and p is only divisible by one
		and itself}.

		The first 5 primes are: 
		1 : 200000033
		2 : 200000039
		3 : 200000051
		4 : 200000069
		5 : 200000081

		The last 5 primes are: 
		52322 : 200999849
		52323 : 200999881
		52324 : 200999927
		52325 : 200999963
		52326 : 200999983

		The total number of primes between 2*10^8 and 2*10^8+10^6 is :
		52326
		The approximate number of primes between 2*10^8 and
		2*10^8+10^6 is : π(J) - π(I) = (J/lnJ) - (I/lnI) = 49574

PART C:

		Calculate the non-crossed-out numbers p such that p = {p ∈
		ℤ | 2*10^8 ≤ p ≤ 2*10^8+10^6}.

		The first 5 numbers not crossed out are: 
		1 : 200000027
		2 : 200000033
		3 : 200000039
		4 : 200000041
		5 : 200000051

		The last 5 numbers not crossed out are: 
		81724 : 200999963
		81725 : 200999969
		81726 : 200999971
		81727 : 200999983
		81728 : 200999989

		The total number of non-crossed-out numbers between 2*10^8 and
		2*10^8+10^6 is : 81728
		The approximate number of primes between 2*10^8 and
		2*10^8+10^6 is : π(J) - π(I) = (J/lnJ) - (I/lnI) = 49574
