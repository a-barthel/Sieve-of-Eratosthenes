This file is where the runtime analysis statistics are stored for each part.
These times were computed using the UNIX time command.  Please note, Part A is
dependent on user IO.  For each subsection of Part A, I tried to run the
desired subsection and exit the program as fast as possible - this should not
affect the system time though.

PART A :

	Subsection 1 (10^6) :
				
		real	0m0.705s
		user	0m0.040s
		sys	0m0.000s

	Subsection 2 (7^t) :

		real	0m0.775s
		user	0m0.040s
		sys	0m0.000s

PART B :

		real	0m0.047s
		user	0m0.040s
		sys	0m0.000s

PART C :

		real	0m0.041s
		user	0m0.030s
		sys	0m0.010s


* These computations were performed on Data *
